🏨 Hospitality Platform Dashboard Project
This project showcases a complete data analysis and visualization solution built for a hospitality platform offering short-term rentals. It aims to deliver actionable insights into property performance, guest satisfaction, and booking trends through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

📁 Project Overview
Utilized three CSV datasets: listings.csv, calendar.csv, and reviews.csv, representing property details, pricing & availability, and guest feedback respectively.

Performed data cleaning and transformation using:

Python (Pandas & NumPy) for initial data wrangling, merging, and feature engineering.

Power Query for additional transformation and optimization within Power BI.

📊 Dashboard Features
The interactive Power BI dashboard consists of multiple analytical views:

Revenue Analysis: Estimate potential earnings based on dynamic availability filters (30, 60, 90, 365 days).

Guest Satisfaction: Explore guest review trends, rating distributions, and host quality indicators.

Geographical Insights: Visualize listing density, pricing hotspots, and neighborhood comparisons using map visuals.

Host Behavior: Identify superhost patterns, responsiveness, and listing portfolio analysis.

Key features include slicers, drillthroughs, tooltips, dynamic DAX measures, and customizable filters.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

BI Tool: Power BI (DAX, Power Query, Advanced Visuals)

Data Format: CSV files

Version Control: Git, GitHub

🎯 Objective
To simulate a real-world business intelligence solution for a hospitality platform by transforming raw booking and review data into meaningful, decision-oriented insights for hosts and platform managers.

🚀 Future Improvements
Incorporate sentiment analysis using NLP on guest reviews.

Integrate forecasting models for occupancy and revenue trends.

Use GeoJSON files for enriched geographical visualizations.

Deploy reports via Power BI Service for real-time collaboration.
